  - `copilotTools.clearAnnotations` command registration
- **Removed functions**:

## What Was Removed

### Core Functionality
- AI-powered code analysis using GitHub Copilot
- Inline suggestions displayed as decorations
- Scope-based analysis (selection, visible area, full document)
- Hover tooltips showing full suggestions

### User Interface
- Right-click context menu option
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+A)
- Command palette entries
- Settings for annotation scope

### Technical Components
- VS Code decoration system integration
- Language model API integration for code analysis
- JSON response parsing from AI
- Line-by-line code examination

## Benefits of Removal
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed ~150 lines of code
- **Reduced dependencies**: No longer using decoration APIs
- **Cleaner UI**: Fewer menu items and commands
- **Focused functionality**: Extension now focuses on core productivity tools

## Remaining Features
The extension still provides:
- ✅ Email Refine tool
- ✅ Text Translation (English ↔ Chinese)
- ✅ Jira Issue Description refining
- ✅ PlantUML Preview and AI Chat Designer
- ✅ Usage Analytics Dashboard
- ✅ Comprehensive settings management

## Version Update
Updated from v0.0.8 to v0.0.9 to reflect this significant feature removal.

The extension is now cleaner and more focused on its core productivity tools without the code annotation functionality.
