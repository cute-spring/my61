# PlantUML Smetana Configuration Test

## Summary
The PlantUML Smetana layout engine support has been successfully implemented and is ready for use.

## Implemented Features ✅

### 1. Configuration Settings (package.json)
- ✅ `plantuml.layoutEngine` setting with "dot" and "smetana" options
- ✅ `plantuml.dotPath` setting for custom DOT executable path
- ✅ Proper default values and descriptions
- ✅ Schema validation with enum descriptions

### 2. Command-line Argument Construction (src/tools/preview.ts)
- ✅ Adds `-Playout=smetana` when Smetana is selected
- ✅ Adds `-DGRAPHVIZ_DOT=<path>` when DOT path is specified and DOT engine is used
- ✅ Reads configuration from VS Code workspace settings
- ✅ Properly integrated with existing PlantUML rendering pipeline

### 3. User Interface (src/extension.ts)
- ✅ `copilotTools.configurePlantUML` command registered
- ✅ Interactive quick-pick UI for layout engine selection
- ✅ Conditional DOT path configuration (only when DOT engine is selected)
- ✅ Smart default path suggestions (Windows vs Unix)
- ✅ Configuration validation and confirmation messages
- ✅ Option to test configuration immediately

### 4. Documentation (README.md)
- ✅ Layout Engine Configuration section explaining both engines
- ✅ Clear instructions for configuration via Command Palette
- ✅ Manual settings configuration documentation
- ✅ Comparison of DOT vs Smetana engines

### 5. Integration
- ✅ UML Chat Panel automatically uses new configuration
- ✅ PlantUML Preview Tool respects layout engine settings
- ✅ All PlantUML rendering throughout the extension is config-aware

## How to Test

### Option 1: Using Command Palette
1. Open Command Palette (⇧⌘P)
2. Run "Configure PlantUML Layout Engine and DOT Path"
3. Select "Smetana" layout engine
4. Confirm configuration
5. Test with UML Chat Designer

### Option 2: Manual Settings
1. Open VS Code Settings (⌘,)
2. Search for "plantuml"
3. Set `plantuml.layoutEngine` to "smetana"
4. Test diagram generation

### Expected Behavior
- **With Smetana**: Diagrams generate without requiring Graphviz/DOT installation
- **With DOT**: High-quality layouts but requires Graphviz installation
- **Custom DOT Path**: Uses specified DOT executable when provided

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Simpler Setup**: Smetana works without external dependencies
- ✅ **Choice**: Can select optimal engine for their environment
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Custom DOT paths for non-standard installations
- ✅ **Easy Configuration**: Simple UI-driven setup process

### For Extension
- ✅ **Reduced Dependencies**: Works in environments without Graphviz
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clearer setup requirements
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Modular configuration system
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms without additional setup

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

The PlantUML Smetana layout engine support is fully implemented, tested, and ready for production use. Users can now:

1. Choose between DOT and Smetana layout engines
2. Configure custom DOT executable paths when needed
3. Generate diagrams without Graphviz when using Smetana
4. Easily switch between engines based on their requirements

All existing functionality is preserved while adding this new capability.
