Explanation: This sequence diagram represents a secure payment processing system. It includes user authentication, integration with a payment gateway, fraud detection checks, communication with the bank, and transaction settlement. Diagram Type: sequence 
```mermaid

participant User
participant AuthService
participant PaymentGateway
participant FraudDetection
participant Bank
participant SettlementService
User->>AuthService: Submit credentials
AuthService->>User: Authentication success
User->>PaymentGateway: Initiate payment
PaymentGateway->>FraudDetection: Perform fraud check
FraudDetection->>PaymentGateway: Fraud check passed
PaymentGateway->>Bank: Process payment
Bank->>PaymentGateway: Payment approved
PaymentGateway->>SettlementService: Initiate settlement
SettlementService->>User: Payment settled

echo "  ✅ Removes explanatory text before the code block"
echo "  ✅ Returns clean sequenceDiagram code"
echo "  ✅ Provides detailed debug logging"

echo "   - Verify that clean Mermaid code is extracted"
echo "   - Check that the diagram renders correctly"
echo "   - Monitor debug logs for extraction details"
