# Test script for Tutorial Button Diagram Visibility
# Tests that the center tutorial button is visible when no diagram is rendered
# and hidden when a diagram is rendered

echo "ðŸ§ª Testing Tutorial Button Diagram Visibility..."
echo "================================================"

# Test 1: Button visible when no diagram
echo "Test 1: Button should be visible when no diagram is rendered"
echo "- Open UML Chat Designer"
echo "- Check that blue 'Tutorial Guide' button is visible in center of right panel"
echo "- Button should be positioned over empty SVG area"

# Test 2: Button hidden when diagram is rendered  
echo ""
echo "Test 2: Button should be hidden when diagram is rendered"
echo "- In UML Chat Designer, send a request: 'Create a simple class diagram for a User class'"
echo "- Wait for AI to generate and render the diagram"
echo "- Check that blue 'Tutorial Guide' button is no longer visible"
echo "- Button should be hidden behind/under the rendered diagram"

# Test 3: Button visible again when diagram is cleared
echo ""
echo "Test 3: Button should be visible again when diagram is cleared"
echo "- Click 'Clear Chat' button to remove all chat history and diagrams"
echo "- Check that blue 'Tutorial Guide' button becomes visible again"
echo "- Button should appear in center of empty SVG area"

# Test 4: Button behavior with multiple diagrams
echo ""
echo "Test 4: Button behavior with multiple diagrams"
echo "- Send another request: 'Create a sequence diagram for login process'"
echo "- Check that button remains hidden when new diagram is rendered"
echo "- Click on previous bot message to render old diagram"
echo "- Check that button stays hidden when switching between diagrams"

# Test 5: Button behavior with onboarding modal
echo ""
echo "Test 5: Button behavior with onboarding modal"
echo "- Clear chat to show button again"
echo "- Click the visible 'Tutorial Guide' button to open onboarding"
echo "- Check that button is hidden while onboarding modal is open"
echo "- Close onboarding modal"
echo "- Check that button becomes visible again (since no diagram is rendered)"

# Test 6: Button behavior with error states
echo ""
echo "Test 6: Button behavior with error states"
echo "- Send a request that might cause an error or invalid diagram"
echo "- Check button visibility when diagram rendering fails"
echo "- Button should be visible if no valid SVG content is rendered"

echo ""
echo "Expected Results:"
echo "âœ… Button visible when SVG area is empty"
echo "âœ… Button hidden when diagram is rendered"
echo "âœ… Button hidden when onboarding modal is active"
echo "âœ… Button visible again when chat is cleared"
echo "âœ… Button remains hidden when switching between rendered diagrams"
echo "âœ… Button visible when diagram rendering fails"

echo ""
echo "Debug Console Messages to Look For:"
echo "- 'Showing center tutorial button - no diagram rendered'"
echo "- 'Hiding center tutorial button - diagram is rendered'"
echo "- 'checkEmptyState called: { hasSvg: true/false, ... }'"

echo ""
echo "Manual Test Instructions:"
echo "1. Open VS Code"
echo "2. Run command: 'UML Chat Designer'"
echo "3. Follow the test steps above"
echo "4. Check console (F12) for debug messages"
echo "5. Verify button visibility matches expected behavior"

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria:"
echo "- Button is only visible when no diagram is rendered"
echo "- Button is hidden whenever a diagram is displayed"
echo "- Button visibility updates correctly on content changes"
echo "- Console logs show correct state transitions"
