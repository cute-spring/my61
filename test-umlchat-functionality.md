# Testing .umlchat File Association

## Implementation Summary

The following changes have been made to enable direct opening of `.umlchat` files:

### 1. Package.json Changes
- Added `languages` section for `.umlchat` file recognition
- Added `customEditors` section to register custom editor for `.umlchat` files
- Added `extension.openUmlChatFile` command
- Added explorer context menu for `.umlchat` files

### 2. Extension.ts Changes
- Created `UmlChatEditorProvider` class implementing `vscode.CustomTextEditorProvider`
- Registered the custom editor provider with VS Code
- Added `openUmlChatFile` function for command handling

### 3. UML Chat Panel Integration
- Modified `umlChatPanelRefactored.ts` to check for pending import data
- Automatic session import when panel opens via file association

## How It Works

1. **File Association**: `.umlchat` files are now associated with the custom editor
2. **Custom Editor**: When opened, the custom editor reads the file content
3. **Session Import**: The session data is parsed and stored temporarily
4. **Panel Opening**: The UML Chat Panel is opened and automatically imports the session
5. **Chat Restoration**: The complete chat history and PlantUML diagram are restored

## Testing Steps

1. **Compile the extension** (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Install the extension** in VS Code development mode:
   - Press F5 to open Extension Development Host
   - Or use "Run Extension" from VS Code's Run and Debug panel

3. **Test file opening**:
   - Navigate to `test-chat-session.umlchat` in the file explorer
   - Right-click and select "Open UML Chat Session"
   - Or double-click the file (should open with custom editor)

4. **Verify functionality**:
   - UML Chat Designer panel should open automatically
   - Chat history should be restored with the sample conversation
   - PlantUML diagram should be displayed

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ `.umlchat` files no longer open in text editor by default
- ✅ Double-clicking `.umlchat` files opens UML Chat Designer
- ✅ Right-click context menu shows "Open UML Chat Session"
- ✅ Chat history and diagrams are automatically restored
- ✅ Error handling for corrupted `.umlchat` files

## Troubleshooting

If the file association doesn't work:
1. Reload VS Code window (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
2. Check that the extension is properly compiled and loaded
3. Verify that `test-chat-session.umlchat` contains valid JSON
4. Check VS Code's Output panel for any error messages

## Sample Test File

The `test-chat-session.umlchat` file contains:
- Valid session data with version, chat history, and PlantUML content
- Sample conversation about creating an e-commerce class diagram
- Complete PlantUML diagram with User, Product, and Order classes
